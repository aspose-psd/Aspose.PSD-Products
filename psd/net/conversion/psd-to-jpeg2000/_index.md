        JPEG 2000 (JP2) is an image coding system and state-of-the-art image compression standard.
        It use wavelet technology to code lossless content in any quality at once.
        Moreover, without any substantial penalty in coding efficiency, JPEG 2000 has the capability to access and decode the same content efficaciously into a variety of other resolutions and qualities.
        The code streams in JPEG 2000 is significantly scalable having regions of interest that provide the facility for spatial random access.
