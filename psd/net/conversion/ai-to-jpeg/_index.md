A file with an .ai extension is an Adobe Illustrator Artwork file that contains vector graphics in a single page. it uses points to create paths for displaying the image data, thus making it safe from losing image quality if it is enlarged. AI file format is base don the PGF file format which are similar to AI files. AI format finds its major usage for logos and print media, and its initial versions were considered similar to that of EPS files. AI files can be opened with Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Acrobat DC, PaintShop Pro, and CorelDraw Graphics tools.

A JPEG is a type of image format that is saved using the method of lossy compression. The output image, as result of compression, is a trade-off between storage size and image quality. Users can adjust the compression level to achieve the desired quality level while at the same time reduce the storage size. Image quality is negligibly affected if 10:1 compression is applied to the image.  The higher the compression value, the higher the degradation in image quality. JPEG image file format was standardized by the Joint Photographic Experts Group and, hence, the name JPEG. The format has been the choice of storing and transmitting photographic images on the web. Almost all Operating systems now have viewers that support visualization of JPEG images, which are often stored with JPG extension as well. Even the web browsers support visualization of JPEG images.
