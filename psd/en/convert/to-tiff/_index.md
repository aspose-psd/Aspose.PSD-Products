<p>Tiff format is a perfect solution for storing the photo in the original quality with additional information. When you choose the tiff format for converting from PSD you can save the most amount of data that presented in the original PSD File. But conversion of PSD to tiff has its own issues. These formats are very different and not all converter can convert all infomation to Tiff without loses. Also, PSD Format has its own metadata that can not be reproduced after the PSD to Tiff conversion. For example PSD stores data of Text Layer in the vector format as well as Smart Object data. You shouldn't convert PSD to Tiff if you want to edit file afterwards. Tiff file supports layers, but tiff is a mostly raster format instead of PSD where is stored a lot of vector data. But if you make conversion of Photo Edited in PSD of Aspose <a href="https://products.aspose.app/psd/photo-editor">Photo Editor</a> the tiff export format is perfect. Then you can edit tiff image with the tiff-specific editors</p>

<p>Result of converting PSD to Tiff can be large in respect of hard disk space. But you get the lossless compressed file with the additional metadata. Not all metadata is properly converted from PSD to Tiff, if you need to extract metadata of PSD Layers, please try <a href="https://products.aspose.app/psd/metadata">PSD Metadata Extractor</a>.
