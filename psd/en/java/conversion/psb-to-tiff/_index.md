        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="PSB" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/psb/" >}}

Adobe photoshop saves files in two formats. Files having 30,000 by 30,000 pixels in size are saved with PSD extension and files larger than PSD upto 300,000 by 300,000 pixels are saved with PSB extension known as “Photoshop Big”. More specifically, PSB files can be as large as 4 EB (over 4.2 billion GB) with images that have a height and width of up to 300,000 pixels. PSDs, on the other hand, can be at maximum upto 2 GB and image dimensions of 30,000 pixels. PSB is also known as large format size for photoshop and supports all the photoshop features like layers, effects and filters.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="TIFF" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/tiff/" >}}

TIFF or TIF, Tagged Image File Format, represents raster images that are meant for usage on a variety of devices that comply with this file format standard. It is capable of describing bilevel, grayscale, palette-color and full-color image data in several color spaces. It supports lossy as well as lossless compression schemes to choose between space and time for applications using the format. The format is extensible and has underwent several revisions that allows the inclusion of an unlimited amount of private or special-purpose information. The format is not machine dependent and is free from bounds like processor, operating system, or file systems.
