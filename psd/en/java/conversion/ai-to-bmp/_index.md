A file with an .ai extension is an Adobe Illustrator Artwork file that contains vector graphics in a single page. it uses points to create paths for displaying the image data, thus making it safe from losing image quality if it is enlarged. AI file format is base don the PGF file format which are similar to AI files. AI format finds its major usage for logos and print media, and its initial versions were considered similar to that of EPS files. AI files can be opened with Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Acrobat DC, PaintShop Pro, and CorelDraw Graphics tools.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="BMP" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/bmp/" >}}
Files having extension .BMP represent Bitmap Image files that are used to store bitmap digital images. These images are independent of graphics adapter and are also called device independent bitmap (DIB) file format. This independency serves the purpose of opening the file on multiple platforms such as Microsoft Windows and Mac. The BMP file format can store data as two-dimensional digital images  in both monochrome as well as color format with various colour depths.
