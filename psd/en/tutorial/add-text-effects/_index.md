<p>
In this tutorial, we'll create a text layer in a PSD file and apply different effects to it, such as shadows and strokes. Text layers are a powerful feature of the PSD format, and adding effects to them can make your designs more visually appealing and attractive.
</p>

<p>
We'll start by creating a new text layer using the Aspose.PSD library and customizing its font, size, and color. Then, we'll add a shadow effect to the text layer to give it depth and dimension. Finally, we'll add a stroke effect to the text layer to create a border around the text.
