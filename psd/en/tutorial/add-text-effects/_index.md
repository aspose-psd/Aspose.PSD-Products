<p>
In this tutorial, we'll create a text layer in a PSD file and apply different effects to it, such as <a href="https://docs.aspose.com/psd/net/shadow-effects-in-psd-file/">shadows</a> and <a href="https://docs.aspose.com/psd/net/stroke-effect-with-color-fill/">strokes</a>. <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/psd/net/aspose.psd.fileformats.psd.layers/textlayer/">Text layers</a> are a powerful feature of the PSD format, and adding effects to them can make your designs more visually appealing and attractive.
</p>

<p>
We'll start by creating a new text layer using the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspose.PSD">Aspose.PSD library</a> and customizing its font, size, and color. Then, we'll add a shadow effect to the text layer to give it depth and dimension. Finally, we'll add a stroke effect to the text layer to create a border around the text.
